= TS3Bot

== Install

Simply run 
  gem install ts3bot, :git => 'git://github.com/aetaric/ts3bot.git'

== Using the bot

  require 'ts3bot'
  @bot = TS3Bot.new
  @bot.run

This will create the initial config file on the 'TS3Bot.new' line and on run the bot will ask you questions to set it up.

== Known caveats

The bot won't work well with Rails and shouldn't be used with it. YMMV but you have been warned.
